Bi-directional carriageways shall have two coloured faces which can be a combination of two colours such as Red-White bi-directional road studs or same colour on two faces like white-white bi-directional road studs or Yellow-Yellow bi-directional road studs. Road studs for four lane divided road, with carriageway width greater than 7.3 m carriageway width is as follows (as per Table 5.2): 
For normal section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 18 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 18 m interval for edge line (optional one) and for traffic lane line is not required.
For warning section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 9 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 9 m interval for edge line (desirable one) and for traffic lane line is not required.
For no overtaking section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 6 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 6 m interval for edge line (desirable one) and white-white bidirectional at 6 m interval for traffic lane line (optional one).
For divided road, in warning section: white-white bidirectional at 9 m interval (optional one) for traffic lane line shall be given.
Road studs must be placed at the center of the gap, never on or beside the line segment at broken longitudinal Markings. Road studs should be 50 mm outside the shoulder edge line, on carriageway with Paved Shoulder. With No Paved Shoulder, roadstuds can be placed directly on the edge line due to space constraints. Road studs should be in the hard strip or kerb shyness width, with 50 mm setback from the median side edge line and 100 mm clearance from the raised kerb on Median Side Edge. Only 50 mm setback is required for Flushed or Depressed Medians; 100 mm clearance is not applicable. If space is insufficient, studs can be placed adjacent to or directly on the edge line. Road Studs with Anchorages is preferable for edge lines but not recommended for concrete roads. Proper installation is required to avoid pavement damage.",IRC:35-2015,5.3
40,Placement Issue,Road Marking,Broken Traffic Lane Line Marking,"The carriageway having two or more in one direction are divided into separate lanes by traffic lane line marking for vehicles to move in proper lanes and to discourage the meandering tendency of the drivers, thereby promoting safety and ensuring maximum capacity. Traffic lane markings should be applied near pedestrian crossings, hazardous locations, congested areas, and important one-way streets, ensuring proper implementation for safety. They must only be used where adequate lane width, as per IRC standards, is available between lane lines or the edge/center line. If sufficient width is not maintained, markings should be avoided to prevent side-swipe accidents. Broken traffic lanes can be crossed whereas continuous traffic lanes shall not be crossed and shall be white in colour.
